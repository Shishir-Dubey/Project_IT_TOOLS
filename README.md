We assume that the marketing department or another system drops every morning
a zip file in 'daily_data'. The zip file is the same as provided by Koby.
Then, Oozie triggers the system to crunch data.

### Important:

- The repository must be cloned in the home dir of the user.

- CHMOD 777 bash_scrips/daily_process.sh

- change the absolute path in pySrcipts/GetWeather.py

How to simulate a full cycle of the system?

- Copy one of Koby's files into daily_data

- Launch bash_scripts/daily_process.sh

- Check the results
