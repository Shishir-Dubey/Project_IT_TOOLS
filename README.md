We assume that the marketing department or another system drops every morning
a zip file in 'daily_data'. The zip file is the same as provided by Koby.
Then, Oozie triggers the system to crunch data.

### Variant.csv must be put in the 'static_data' folder.

### The repository must be cloned in the home dir of the user.

How to simulate a full cycle of the system?

- Copy one of Koby's files into daily_data

- Launch bash_scripts/daily_process.sh

- Check the results
