We assume that marketing department or another system drops every morning
a zip file in 'daily_data' as the ones provided by Koby.
Then, Oozie triggers the system to crunch data.

Important1: Variant.csv must be put in the 'static_data' folder.

Important2: The zip file must be uncompressed in the home dir of the user.

How to simulate a full cycle of the system?
1/ Copy one of Koby's files into daily_data
2/ Launch bash_scripts/daily_process.sh
3/ check the results
